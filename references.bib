    abstract = "{Despite the rapid increase of size in phylogenomic data sets, a number of important nodes on animal phylogeny are still unresolved. Among these, the rooting of the placental mammal tree is still a controversial issue. One difficulty lies in the pervasive phylogenetic conflicts among genes, with each one telling its own story, which may be reliable or not. Here, we identified a simple criterion, that is, the GC content, which substantially helps in determining which gene trees best reflect the species tree. We assessed the ability of 13,111 coding sequence alignments to correctly reconstruct the placental phylogeny. We found that GC-rich genes induced a higher amount of conflict among gene trees and performed worse than AT-rich genes in retrieving well-supported, consensual nodes on the placental tree. We interpret this GC effect mainly as a consequence of genome-wide variations in recombination rate. Indeed, recombination is known to drive GC-content evolution through GC-biased gene conversion and might be problematic for phylogenetic reconstruction, for instance, in an incomplete lineage sorting context. When we focused on the AT-richest fraction of the data set, the resolution level of the placental phylogeny was greatly increased, and a strong support was obtained in favor of an Afrotheria rooting, that is, Afrotheria as the sister group of all other placentals. We show that in mammals most conflicts among gene trees, which have so far hampered the resolution of the placental tree, are concentrated in the GC-rich regions of the genome. We argue that the GC content—because it is a reliable indicator of the long-term recombination rate—is an informative criterion that could help in identifying the most reliable molecular markers for species tree inference.}",

The main contribution of this version is the increase in the number of taxa: 116 mammalian genomes for 14,509 one-to-one orthologous genes. This has been made possible by the combination of genomic data deposited in Ensembl complemented by additional good-quality genomes only available in NCBI.

    abstract = "{Full genome data sets are currently being explored on a regular basis to infer phylogenetic trees, but there are often discordances among the trees produced by different genes. An important goal in phylogenomics is to identify which individual gene and species produce the same phylogenetic tree and are thus likely to share the same evolutionary history. On the other hand, it is also essential to identify which genes and species produce discordant topologies and therefore evolve in a different way or represent noise in the data. The latter are outlier genes or species and they can provide a wealth of information on potentially interesting biological processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, and horizontal gene transfers. Here, we propose a new method to explore the genomic tree space and detect outlier genes and species based on multiple co-inertia analysis (MCOA), which efficiently captures and compares the similarities in the phylogenetic topologies produced by individual genes. Our method allows the rapid identification of outlier genes and species by extracting the similarities and discrepancies, in terms of the pairwise distances, between all the species in all the trees, simultaneously. This is achieved by using MCOA, which finds successive decomposition axes from individual ordinations (i.e., derived from distance matrices) that maximize a covariance function. The method is freely available as a set of R functions. The source code and tutorial can be found online at http://phylomcoa.cgenomics.org.}",

abstract = {Abstract STATIS is an extension of principal component analysis (PCA) tailored to handle multiple data tables that measure sets of variables collected on the same observations, or, alternatively, as in a variant called dual-STATIS, multiple data tables where the same variables are measured on different sets of observations. STATIS proceeds in two steps: First it analyzes the between data table similarity structure and derives from this analysis an optimal set of weights that are used to compute a linear combination of the data tables called the compromise that best represents the information common to the different data tables; Second, the PCA of this compromise gives an optimal map of the observations. Each of the data tables also provides a map of the observations that is in the same space as the optimum compromise map. In this article, we present STATIS, explain the criteria that it optimizes, review the recent inferential extensions to STATIS and illustrate it with a detailed example. We also review, and present in a common framework, the main developments of STATIS such as (1) X-STATIS or partial triadic analysis (PTA) which is used when all data tables collect the same variables measured on the same observations (e.g., at different times or locations), (2) COVSTATIS, which handles multiple covariance matrices collected on the same observations, (3) DISTATIS, which handles multiple distance matrices collected on the same observations and generalizes metric multidimensional scaling to three way distance matrices, (4) Canonical-STATIS (CANOSTATIS), which generalizes discriminant analysis and combines it with DISTATIS to analyze multitable discriminant analysis problems, (5) power-STATIS, which uses alternative criteria to find STATIS optimal weights, (6) ANISOSTATIS, which extends STATIS to give specific weights to each variable rather than to each whole table, (7) (K + 1)-STATIS (or external-STATIS), which extends STATIS (and PLS-methods and Tucker inter battery analysis) to the analysis of the relationships of several data sets and one external data set, and (8) double-STATIS (or DO-ACT), which generalizes (K + 1)-STATIS and analyzes two sets of data tables, and STATIS-4, which generalizes double-STATIS to more than two sets of data. These recent developments are illustrated by small examples.

    abstract = "{ We present a fast and flexible software package—SimPhy—for the simulation of multiple gene families evolving under incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer—all three potentially leading to species tree/gene tree discordance—and gene conversion. SimPhy implements a hierarchical phylogenetic model in which the evolution of species, locus, and gene trees is governed by global and local parameters (e.g., genome-wide, species-specific, locus-specific), that can be fixed or be sampled from a priori statistical distributions. SimPhy also incorporates comprehensive models of substitution rate variation among lineages (uncorrelated relaxed clocks) and the capability of simulating partitioned nucleotide, codon, and protein multilocus sequence alignments under a plethora of substitution models using the program INDELible. We validate SimPhy's output using theoretical expectations and other programs, and show that it scales extremely well with complex models and/or large trees, being an order of magnitude faster than the most similar program (DLCoal-Sim). In addition, we demonstrate how SimPhy can be useful to understand interactions among different evolutionary processes, conducting a simulation study to characterize the systematic overestimation of the duplication time when using standard reconciliation methods. SimPhy is available at https://github.com/adamallo/SimPhy , where users can find the source code, precompiled executables, a detailed manual and example cases. }",
